- RESTful API design

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /todos` - Retrieve all todos
- `POST /todos` - Create new todo
- `GET /*` - Serve static files

---

### Slide 6: Docker Containerization
**Dockerfile Strategy:**
```dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine          # Minimal, secure base
WORKDIR /usr/src/app         # Consistent structure
COPY package*.json ./        # Layer caching optimization
RUN npm ci --only=production # Fast, reliable installs
COPY app/ ./                 # Application code
EXPOSE 3000                  # Port documentation
CMD ["node","app.js"]        # Process execution
```

**Benefits Achieved:**
- 150MB optimized image size
- Consistent environment across dev/prod
- Fast deployment and scaling
- Security with Alpine Linux

---

### Slide 7: Kubernetes Orchestration
**Components Deployed:**
- **Deployment**: Manages pod lifecycle and scaling
- **Service**: NodePort for external access
- **ReplicaSet**: Ensures desired pod count
- **Pod**: Contains application container

**Configuration Highlights:**
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: devops-todo
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: devops-todo
```

---

### Slide 8: CI/CD Pipeline
**GitHub Actions Workflow:**

1. **Trigger**: Push to main branch
2. **Build**: Create Docker image with commit SHA tag
3. **Test**: Ready for test integration
4. **Push**: Upload to Docker Hub registry
5. **Deploy**: Optional Kubernetes update

**Pipeline Benefits:**
- Automated builds on every commit
- Consistent deployment process
- Rollback capability with tagged images
- Zero manual intervention required

---

### Slide 9: Security Implementation
